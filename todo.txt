Implement the feature on mails in which when we click on any mail
it will show the sender, subject and body of the mail.

Now I will make the above feature do something like below mentioned info.:
    When I'm on my default page it will show the link like below:
        127.0.0.1:8080/inbox
    When I'm on my other mailbox then it will show the name of that
    mailbox in place of inbox 
    When I opened an email then it will show the link with the mailbox 
    something just like the below written one:
        127.0.0.1:8080/inbox/8
    
    So now Let's start the Work.
